[+] Description [+]
-------------------
secutils is a python-written small set of utilities that helps with report generation from security tools such as Nmap, Nessus, Netsparker and Acunetix. 

The aim of this tool is to help security teams to save time when creating reports from their findings with automated tools. secutils will generate Excel reports to allow having all the information from different tools in one single report.

[+] Overview [+]
----------------
secutils has a number of command line arguments described below:

$ secutils --help
usage: secutils.py [-h] [-v] [-o OUTPUT-FILE] [-t DIR [DIR ...]]
                   [-p DIR [DIR ...]] [-rn DIR [DIR ...]] [-rN DIR [DIR ...]]
                   [-T FILE] [-ra DIR [DIR ...]] [-rk DIR [DIR ...]]

MISC:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -v, --version      show program's version number and exit
  -o OUTPUT-FILE     Set an xls output file

NMAP UTILITIES:
  -t DIR [DIR ...]   Create a list of targets from nmap files in xml format located in DIR
  -p DIR [DIR ...]   Create list of open ports from nmap files in xml format located in DIR
  -rn DIR [DIR ...]  Create an XLS report from nmap files in xml format located in DIR

NESSUS UTILITIES:
  -rN DIR [DIR ...]  Create an XLS report from .nessus files located in DIR
  -T FILE            Use an xls database FILE to translate nessus reports. Must be used along with -rN

ACUNETIX UTILITIES:
  -ra DIR [DIR ...]  Create an XLS report from acunetix files in xml format located in DIR

NETSPARKER UTILITIES:
  -rk DIR [DIR ...]  Create an XLS report from netsparker files in xml format located in DIR

EXAMPLES: 
            python secutils.py -t Project/Discovery/ -p Project/Enum/
            python secutils.py -rn Project/Discovery/target1 -o Report
            python secutils.py -rN Project/target1/nessus Project/target2/nessus/ -T VulnsDB_Spanish.xls -o Report.xls


[+] Requirements [+]
--------------------
* Python 2.7.x (https://www.python.org)
Programmed and tested on Python 2.7.9

* External python packages:
- wlrd (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd)
- xlwt (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlwt)
- xlutils (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlutils)

* Vulnerabilities database
Only if nessus report translation is required. In order to translate the vulnerabilities reported by Nessus, it is necessary a database of translated vulnerabilities. secutils uses an Excel database file following the structure below:

- Column A: Nessus Plugin
- Column B: Synopsis
- Column C: Description
- Column D: Solution

These 4 columns are the required ones for secutils to work; it will start to look for a plugin from row 2, so row 1 can be used to write the titles as described in the structure above.

* Netsparker reports
The .xml reports from Netsparker must be generated with the "Detailed Scan Report (XML).xml.cshtml" template stored in the "netsparker template" folder distributed with secutils in order to get the complete description from findings. Currently, this template supports only Netsparker <= 4.5.2.0
